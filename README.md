# Thyroid Classification Project

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains code and resources for a machine learning and neural network-based thyroid classification project. The primary objective of this project is to classify thyroid records as Hyperthyroid, Hypothyroid, or Euthyroid using the UCI thyroid datasets. The project showcases a wide range of machine learning algorithms and advanced neural network models.

## Project Highlights

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- K Nearest Neighbor
- Multi-layer Perceptron

### Neural Network Models
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

### Hybrid Model
We've created a unique Hybrid Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Bayes model that combines the strengths of both approaches to improve classification accuracy.

## Results
Our models have achieved an impressive average classification accuracy of 98%, surpassing the performance of several existing models in thyroid classification. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in accurately diagnosing thyroid conditions.
